# Tally

## Background
Tally allows users to to create virtual Households to store their boardgames making it convenient to throw Game Nights and track wins. Each user has a personal leaderboard on their profile page, tallying wins by game. Households display users with the most wins and top winners for each boardgame in their cabinet. The goal of tally is to create friendly competition to keep friends coming back together to play.

## Our Plan 
Check out our original plan here: [Tally Original Figma](https://github.com/hollidavis/Tally/blob/readme/Tally.pdf)

## Features
- Users create a household and add games from their home to the virtual household.
- Household owner can send friends the access code so they can join their household.
- Households can schedule and hold game nights.
- On the game nights, household owners can select a game from their cabinet to play and submit wins/losses for all players who joined the game night.
- Profile pages display personal leaderboard with their total wins per game.
- Household pages show leaderboards for each game in the cabinet with users ranked by their wins.

## Future Improvements
- When a game night is scheduled, anyone who joins can vote once for the game they want to play most
- Email notification when your high score is beaten (you are dethroned)
- G-rated trash talk ("You're going down!", etc)
- Allow users to rate games
- Add a winner to the household leaderboard who doesn't have an account
- Show login form directly on the landing page instead of having a pop-up
- Give users levels based on the total number of plays (novice to master)
